# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
assume the keywords for the program

### Step 2: 
assign the values of first variable

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](./formula.JPG)



### Step 4: 
assign the values of second variable

### Step 5: 
print the distance d

### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.

#RegisterNumber:22002828
import math as m
l2=[4,2]
l1=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
![output](./distance%20between%20two%20points.png)




### RESULT:
thus the distance between the two points are successfully executed
